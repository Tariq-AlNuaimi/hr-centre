## Add a page

1. Create `content/docs/<slug>.mdx`:

   ```mdx
   ---
   title: My page title
   description: One-line summary (optional).
   ---

   Body in Markdown/MDX.
   ```

2. Commit and push. The page renders at `/docs/<slug>` and appears in the
   sidebar after the build — no code change.

A page **must** carry a `title` in its frontmatter: a missing/malformed
frontmatter fails the build with the offending file path, so a broken page can
never ship silently.

## Access

The docs site is **internal-only by default**: it sits behind the app's login
like every other protected page. To make docs public, remove the session check
in `app/[locale]/docs/layout.tsx` and add `/docs` to `publicPaths` in
`middleware.ts` — and put **only non-Restricted content** in `content/docs/**`
(see `SECURITY.md` §1 for the data classes).
