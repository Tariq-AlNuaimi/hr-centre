# Findings register (wave-offs must be logged, never silent)

Every time a finding is **not fixed** — deferred, accepted as a known limitation,
declared an intentional trade-off, a "judgment call" handed to the operator, a
skipped QA phase, or a lint/rule suppression — it gets a dated line here. The
point is that "acceptable" is a recorded, reviewable decision, not a silent
shrug (complaint #12). `/qa` refuses to green a release while a wave-off touching
the changed surface is still **open** (un-adjudicated).

- **Security** suppressions (gitleaks / Semgrep / npm-audit / an ESLint security
  rule) go in **SECURITY.md §12**, not here — this register is for the rest
  (the four non-security pillars, UX/design judgment calls, skipped QA phases,
  deferred functionality).
- One line per wave-off. Newest at the top.
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD — [pillar/area] <finding> — WHY waived — <owner/operator> — status: open | adjudicated(<date>) | fixed(<commit>)`
- A wave-off is **open** until the operator adjudicates it (accepts or schedules
  it) or it's fixed. Don't mark something adjudicated on the operator's behalf.

## Register

<!-- newest first -->

- 2026-07-11 — [quality/ai] ai-eval /ship gate is DORMANT — the LLM-as-judge eval gate
  (`scripts/ai-eval.mjs`, wired into /ship phase B) is a no-op that exits 0 (SKIP) until a fork
  BOTH sets AI_API_KEY and writes >=1 tests/ai-evals/*.eval.ts fixture (and points AI_EVAL_BASE_URL
  at a running/deployed app). The pristine template has neither, so it always SKIPs green — AI
  output-quality scoring is unenforced here BY DESIGN, mirroring the dormant lhci gate (ADR-020
  dormancy pattern). Not silently dropped: it self-activates the moment a fork turns AI on + writes
  fixtures, and a CI variant (ai-eval.yml against a preview URL) is scheduled to land at the
  ADR-007/037 Actions-activation line. — owner: operator — status: adjudicated(2026-07-11)
  (accepted: dormant-by-design gate on the ADR-020 pattern; self-activates per-fork)
- 2026-07-11 — [quality] WS-5 pgvector RAG seam (ADR-043) is UNVERIFIED in-session —
  lib/ai/embeddings.ts + lib/ai/rag.ts + prisma/migrations/20260711120000_pgvector_rag were authored
  to spec, but there is **no pgvector-enabled Postgres and no embeddings egress** in the build
  environment, so the migration is **UNAPPLIED** and no provider round-trip or vector query ran here.
  Like the WS-1 distroless image wave-off, verification is delegated to a fork/CI with the
  infrastructure. Highest-risk unknowns a fork must confirm: the `vector` extension + `<=>` cosine
  operator + HNSW index resolve on the target Postgres (Neon supports `vector`), and the chosen
  model's dimension matches `vector(1536)` (voyage-3 / embed-english-v3.0 emit 1024 — ALTER the
  column + set EMBEDDINGS_DIMENSIONS in lockstep, else INSERT fails loud). **Not silently dropped —
  recorded for the operator to adjudicate**; the fix at activation: apply the migration against a
  pgvector DB, set EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER + EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY, and exercise ragUpsert/ragQuery. —
  owner: operator — status: adjudicated(2026-07-11) (accepted: infra-unavailable in-session;
  verification delegated to a pgvector-capable fork/CI, same posture as the WS-1 image wave-off)
- 2026-07-11 — [quality] WS-6 Ory Polis SSO/SCIM seam (ADR-045) is UNVERIFIED in-session —
  lib/sso/* + app/api/internal/scim + the generic OIDC provider in lib/auth.ts + the `sso` compose
  profile were authored to the documented Ory Polis / BoxyHQ dsync contract, but **no live Polis
  sidecar was booted**, so the OIDC handshake params (`checks:["state"]`, client_secret_post) and
  the SCIM webhook shape ran no real round-trip. ADR-045 + the blueprint promised this line; it is
  now recorded (senior-review 2026-07-11 flagged the promised-but-missing entry as a governance gate
  hole). Verification delegated to a fork/CI with a real IdP, same posture as the WS-1 image + WS-5
  RAG wave-offs. Fix at activation: `--profile sso` up, create a Polis SSO connection, complete a
  SAML→OIDC login + a dsync provisioning event end-to-end. — owner: operator —
  status: adjudicated(2026-07-11) (accepted: infra-unavailable in-session; verification delegated to
  a Polis-capable fork/CI)
- 2026-07-11 — [secure] ADR-041 P0 item (c) — **SAST-as-a-hard-CI-gate + `zizmor` action-pin
  audit are DEFERRED to CI activation, not landed in WS-2.** ADR-041 and the enterprise-P0
  blueprint (AC-4.3) list "promote `sast.yml` from dormant to a hard blocking gate" + add `zizmor`
  as P0. On the current free GitHub plan Actions billing is blocked, so every CI workflow —
  `sast.yml` included — is intentionally dormant (`on: workflow_dispatch` only; ADR-007/037): flipping
  the push/PR triggers now would fail-in-2s, not gate anything. So the _hard-gate_ half is only
  meaningful once CI activates (at `/handoff` to a paid-Actions team, or when billing unblocks) — the
  same activation line ADR-037 already defines. **Interim control:** the Semgrep ruleset is mirrored
  locally by the `/audit` skill (runs on demand), and the trivy-pin + SHA-pin halves of ADR-041 P0
  DID land in WS-2a. `zizmor` is not yet wired. **Not silently dropped — recorded here for the
  operator to adjudicate**; the fix at activation is to restore `sast.yml`'s real triggers + add a
  `zizmor` workflow step. — owner: operator — status: adjudicated(2026-07-11) (accepted:
  program-level deferral to CI activation — the risk description stands, but the _hard-gate_ half is
  only meaningful once Actions runs; interim control is the local `/audit` Semgrep mirror + the
  landed trivy/SHA pins. RE-OPENS at the CI/Actions-activation line — `/handoff` to a paid-Actions
  team, or billing unblocking — when `sast.yml`'s push/PR triggers are restored and the `zizmor`
  action-pin audit step is added)
- 2026-07-11 — [quality] WS-1 Docker image build is UNVERIFIED in-session — the enterprise self-host
  image (distroless Node 24 + `compose.prod.yaml` + Caddy) was authored to spec but there is **no
  Docker daemon in the build environment**, so it was not built/booted here. Per ADR-030 the image
  gate degrades to a WARN when no daemon is present and build-verification is delegated to CI
  (`docker-build.yml`) or a build-capable machine. Highest-risk unknown a build must confirm: the
  Prisma 7 client/query-engine resolves at runtime inside distroless `nodejs24-debian12` (glibc +
  libssl present, but confirm on a real boot). Base tags are patch-pinned; Renovate applies the
  `@sha256:` digest pin (ADR-041). — owner: operator — status: adjudicated(2026-07-11) (accepted:
  infra-unavailable in-session — no Docker daemon in the build env; per ADR-030 the image gate
  degrades to a WARN and build-verification is delegated to a build-capable env, same posture as the
  pgvector RAG wave-off above. The runtime-resolution risk stands unchanged. RE-OPENS when the
  `docker-build` CI workflow — or a build-capable machine — actually builds + boots the distroless
  image and confirms the Prisma 7 client/query-engine resolves at runtime)
- 2026-07-03 — [maintainable] deferred-adoption #11 (specialist-agents) — **drop REVERSED by
  operator same day; now ADOPT.** The earlier drop reasoned that a stack-aware _review_ seed would
  duplicate `senior-code-reviewer`. The operator redirected it: build it as a **build-time ADVISOR**
  (not a reviewer), which occupies a genuinely different slot (advice while building vs. review after
  push) and does not duplicate the review rail. Design + skill-vs-subagent mechanism analysis pinned
  in `docs/blueprints/deferred-11-specialist-stack-advisor.md`. **IMPLEMENTED session 15 (2026-07-03)**
  as the `/stack-advisor` skill (`.claude/skills/stack-advisor/SKILL.md`, wired into
  `.claude/skill-rules.json`) — one composed advisor, positive patterns only, explicit
  "I advise, I do not review" boundary; the optional thin subagent was not built (no offload need yet).
  — owner: operator — status: fixed(8d0aa61) (blueprinted → built → landing on main)
- 2026-07-02 — [secure/maintainable] pristine-flag CLEARING is best-effort (warn-only, no
  retry/ack): `new-project.mjs` reads back `project.config.json` via the GitHub Contents API
  immediately after template-`generate` (which populates the file tree asynchronously) with no
  poll/retry, and `deploy.mjs` rewrites the flag only in the local working copy and relies on the
  operator to commit. If either clear silently fails, the fork keeps `"pristine": true` and — until
  it runs `/scaffold-entity` — ships GREEN with zero domain models, narrowly reopening the bypass
  the `fixed(34f1114)` change closed (senior-review 2026-07-02, confidence 84) — WHY deferred: the
  robust fix (mirror new-project's existing env-propagation retry loop for the Contents read + a
  `dbAck`-style breadcrumb so `scanDbStructure` refuses a stale `pristine:true` whose clear failed)
  is Ask-before fork-script surgery, and Workstream B item 4 already reopens these three provisioning
  scripts next session; risk is narrow (only a not-yet-scaffolded fork whose clear silently failed)
  — owner: operator — status: adjudicated(2026-07-02) scheduled into Workstream B item 4
- 2026-07-02 — [secure/maintainable] db-structure gate's pristine-template exemption keys
  only on `package.json.name === "fullstack-next-template"`, which only `/rebrand` rewrites —
  a fork created via `/new-project`/`/deploy` without `/rebrand` stays silently exempt from
  the ADR-031 domain-model check (`scripts/ship.mjs` `TEMPLATE_PKG_NAME`; senior-review
  2026-07-02, confidence 85) — WHY deferred: fix needs a coordinated stamp across all three
  fork-creation scripts (or a `project.config.json` pristine flag), too invasive at session
  end; checks (b)+(c) still run everywhere — owner: operator — status: fixed(34f1114)
  (replaced the package-name proxy with an explicit `"pristine": true` flag in
  project.config.json read by `scanDbStructure`; every fork-creation path clears it —
  rebrand.mjs, deploy.mjs, new-project.mjs)

## Standing wave-offs promoted to documented trade-offs

<!--
When a wave-off is a permanent, intentional design choice (not a deferral), it
graduates out of the live register into a documented "known trap" in CLAUDE.md or
an ADR — then delete its line above. These are the already-documented ones, kept
here as pointers so they aren't re-litigated as new findings:
-->

- File uploads not wired; PDF export intentionally absent from `lib/export.ts` (ADR-006).
- Rate limiter is in-memory per-instance (fine single-instance; Upstash via `/scale-up`).
- CSP allows `'unsafe-inline'` script+style (AntD SSR + Next bootstrap).
  (See CLAUDE.md "Known traps" for the full list.)
